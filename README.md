# Developing an AI application to classify flowers

This project is part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree Term 1. It uses a proprietary data set and a general demographics data set to identify segments of the population that could potentially be new clients for a mail-order service in Germany.

## Installation
The code requires Python versions of 3.* and general libraries available through the Anaconda package.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This project is part of the work required by the Data Science Nanodegree Program offered by Udacity.

## File Description <a name="description"></a>
There is one Jupyter notebook containing the code to cluster the general population of Germany as well as the customer base of the mail-order service in Germany into segments. The notebook contains many lines of data cleaning functions as well as the k-means algorithm and principal component analysis.

## Results
Based on the analysis, the population was clustered into eleven segments and two clusters were particularly overrepresented. These two population clusters were characterized by middle-agers, both male and female, living a bit farther away from a point of sale, being rather traditional and rational with a high income.
